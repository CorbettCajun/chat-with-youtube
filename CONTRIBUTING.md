# Contributing to AI Chat with Documents

We love your input! We want to make contributing as easy and transparent as possible.

## Development Process

We use GitHub to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests
3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation
4. Ensure the test suite passes
5. Make sure your code lints
6. Issue that pull request!

## Pull Request Process

1. Update the README.md with details of changes if needed
2. Update the .env.example if you've added new environment variables
3. The PR will be merged once you have the sign-off of other developers

## Report Bugs Using GitHub's [Issue Tracker](issues)

We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by [opening a new issue](issues/new).

## Write Bug Reports With Detail, Background, and Sample Code

**Great Bug Reports** tend to have:

- A quick summary and/or background
- Steps to reproduce
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happens
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening)
